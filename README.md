### Instructions
Choose a category and answer the questions in it. 
If you finish answering 10 questions in any category, you win the game! 
Try and get a perfect score in all the categories! If you get tired of trivia, 
and feel like learning something new, check out the random fun fact generator, or if you're 
in the mood for a silly joke check out the joke generator for some good laughs.

### Features
This project was built using React, Bulma, Javascript, HTML and CSS. It uses 4 different 
API's - one to generate the trivia questions, one for fun math facts, one for general fun facts and one to generate a random joke. 
It also has a light/dark mode feature that can be used to update the theme of your page.
You can change between categories at any time but beware that changing categories will erase your progress from your current
category unless you press submit. Pressing submit gives you your score and tells you whether you got any questions wrong and which ones 
you got wrong.
